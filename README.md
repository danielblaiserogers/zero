# A simple web server that serves a static HTML file.
# This script uses Python's built-in http.server module, so no external libraries are needed.
# Set the port for the server to run on.
# Create a handler to serve files from the current directory.
# The SimpleHTTPRequestHandler is a built-in class for this purpose.
# Start the server. The with statement ensures the server is properly closed.
# Run the server indefinitely until it is manually stopped.
